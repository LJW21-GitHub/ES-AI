# ES-AI (WIP)

An application to help you memorize things quickly !

## Installation : 

- Download the application using the zip file or git clone
- run ai_gui.py using python3

## Usage :

- ask the ai questions ! (in french for now)
- click "train me" or use train in cli : the chatbot will ask back the questions, check if you learned ! (for now the chatbot comes with an example database containing atomic number and molar mass of a few atoms. a customisable database system is planned, but it's still in the work !)
- aaaand not really much to do for now. still WIP !
